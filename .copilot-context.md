Gator AI Influencer Platform - Context File for GitHub Copilot

This file provides comprehensive context for GitHub Copilot to generate
high-quality, consistent code for the Gator platform.

PROJECT OVERVIEW:
The Gator platform is an AI-powered influencer content generation system that:
- Creates consistent AI personas with defined appearance and personality
- Generates social media content using text-to-image models
- Ingests trending topics from RSS feeds
- Automatically posts content to social platforms
- Ensures ethical AI usage with content moderation

ARCHITECTURE:
- Backend: FastAPI with async/await patterns
- Database: PostgreSQL with SQLAlchemy ORM
- Caching: Redis for session and content caching
- AI Models: Hugging Face transformers, Stable Diffusion
- Task Queue: Celery for background processing
- Frontend: React/TypeScript (when implemented)
- Container: Docker with docker-compose

KEY COMPONENTS:
1. Persona Engine: Manages AI character definitions and consistency
2. Content Generator: Text-to-image generation with persona context
3. Feed Ingestion: RSS parsing and topic extraction
4. Social Integration: Multi-platform posting automation
5. Content Moderation: NSFW, bias, and toxicity detection
6. Analytics: Performance tracking and insights

DATA MODELS:
- PersonaData: Character appearance, personality, preferences
- GeneratedContent: Images/videos with metadata and analytics
- FeedItem: Parsed RSS content with extracted topics
- SocialPost: Published content with engagement metrics
- User: Platform users with authentication and permissions

CODING PATTERNS:
- Use Pydantic for data validation and serialization
- Implement async/await for all I/O operations
- Use dependency injection for services
- Add comprehensive logging and error handling
- Include type hints for all functions
- Follow REST API conventions
- Implement proper authentication and authorization

SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
- All AI-generated content must be marked as such
- Implement content moderation before publication
- Use secure password hashing and JWT tokens
- Validate and sanitize all user inputs
- Log security-relevant events
- Implement rate limiting on all endpoints

ETHICAL CONSIDERATIONS:
- Ensure transparent AI-generated content labeling
- Implement bias detection and mitigation
- Respect consent for likeness usage
- Provide data deletion and export capabilities
- Regular auditing of AI model outputs
- Compliance with regional content regulations

PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:
- Support concurrent content generation
- Implement caching for expensive operations
- Optimize GPU memory usage for AI models
- Use batch processing where appropriate
- Monitor and limit resource usage

ERROR HANDLING:
- Use custom exceptions for different error types
- Implement graceful degradation for AI model failures
- Log errors with sufficient context for debugging
- Provide meaningful error messages to users
- Implement retry logic for transient failures

TESTING APPROACH:
- Unit tests for business logic
- Integration tests for API endpoints
- Mock external services and AI models
- Test bias and content moderation
- Performance testing for AI workloads

When generating code, always consider:
- Security implications of AI-generated content
- Ethical usage of AI models
- Performance impact of ML operations
- Proper error handling and logging
- Type safety and validation
- Documentation and maintainability
