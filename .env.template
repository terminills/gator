# =====================================
# GATOR AI PLATFORM - BOOTSTRAP CONFIG
# =====================================
# This .env file should be MINIMAL - only what's needed to start the app.
# All other configuration is stored in the database and managed via UI/API.

# Database Connection (REQUIRED - Bootstrap only)
DATABASE_URL=sqlite:///./gator.db

# Application Secret (REQUIRED - Security)
SECRET_KEY=change-this-to-a-random-secret-key-in-production

# Optional: Development Settings
# DEBUG=true
# GATOR_ENV=development

# =====================================
# EVERYTHING ELSE IS IN THE DATABASE
# =====================================
# 
# The following are managed via /admin/settings or API:
#
# ✅ AI API Keys (OpenAI, Anthropic, ElevenLabs, etc.)
# ✅ Social Media Credentials (Facebook, Instagram, Twitter)
# ✅ Branding (Site name, colors, logo)
# ✅ Model Configuration (Paths, models, settings)
# ✅ Storage Paths (Uploads, generated content)
# ✅ Rate Limits and Thresholds
# ✅ Email/SMTP Settings
# ✅ Monitoring Integration (Sentry, Prometheus)
# ✅ DNS Management (GoDaddy keys)
# ✅ AWS/Cloud Credentials
# ✅ And more...
#
# Why? 
# - Update settings without restarting
# - Manage via UI instead of editing files
# - Per-tenant configuration (multi-tenant ready)
# - Secure credential storage with encryption
# - Audit trail of configuration changes
#
# To configure:
# 1. Start app: python -m backend.api.main
# 2. Visit: http://localhost:8000/admin/settings
# 3. Or use API: http://localhost:8000/docs
